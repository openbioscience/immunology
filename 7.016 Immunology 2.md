# Lecture 31: Immunology 2 - Memory, T cells, and Autoimmunity

## agenda
1. Antigen presentation
2. TCR and class restriction
3. Autoimmunity

### antigen presentation
- listeria is an **intracellular** bacterial infection
- how are immune cells able to see within other cells?
- **antigen presentation.** peptides are displayed on the cell surface for immune cells to see (T cells to see)
- **major histocompatibility complex (MHC).**
  - **Class 1 MHC.**
    - expressed on all nucleated cells
    - presented peptides are derived from the cytoplasm
      - peptides processed/cut by the **proteasome**
    - recognized by **CD8+ T cells**
  - **Class 2 MHC.**
    - displays peptides as well
    - expressed on specialized cells called **antigen presenting cells**
      - **antigen presenting cells**
        - B cells
        - phagocytic cells
    - presented peptides derived from extracellular space
      - peptides processed/cut by lysosomal proteases
    - recognized by **CD4+ T cells**

### T cells
- T-cell receptor (TCR)
  - diversity of TCRs
    - source of diversity is same as diversity of Abs -> **VDJ recombination** in _genomic DNA_.
  - co-receptors (on T cells)
    - CD4 -> recognize MHC Class 2
    - CD8 -> recognize MHC Class 1
  - CD8 = intracellular source of proteins = something wrong with cell
    - therefore, CD8+ T cell -> something wrong inside cell -> **Kill the cell**
    - **CD8+ T cell = Killer T cell = Cytotoxic T cell**
  - CD4 = extracellular source of proteins = something outside the cell
    - MHC Class 2 presented on B cells
    - therefore, should notify/activate B cells to create antibodies
    - **CD4+ T cell = Helper T cells**
      - induces **affinity maturation**. weak binding -> tighter binding
      - **isotype switching.** changes the constant domains which leads to different effector functions
        - IgM (membrane bound)
        - IgG (secreted) -> bacteria
        - IgA (mucosal immunity -> passes through epithelial linings)
        - IgE -> worms
      - differentiation of B cells into memory B cells
- T and B cells meet in **lymph nodes**

### autoimmune disorders
- Tolerance vs. Autoimmune
- 10's of millions of Ag receptors
  - production of Ag receptors is
    - constitutive
    - random
- how does the immune system distinguish between self and foreign?
  - goal
    - self-recognition -> negative selection -> apoptosis
    - foreign -> positive selection -> cell division/expansion
  - methods to distinguish
    - only self Ags in the generative lymphoid organs (bone marrow, thymus)
      - lymphoid organs are protected from foreign invaders
      - thus, any Ag binding must be a self Ag and should be deleted
    - using innate immune response
      - Ag + innate immune response = foreign
      - Ag only = self
      - in vaccines: need an **adjuvant** to activate the innate immune response
- 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
  - James Allison
  - Tasuku Honjo
  - discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation
  - **inhibitory receptors on T cells**
    - CTLA-4, PD1
    - involved in signal termination
  - use a inhibitory blockade to disable the inhibitory receptors
    - can lead to autoimmune reactions and inflammation
