## notes
- immunity - resistance to disease based on a prior exposure
- two levels of the immune system
  - innate immunity
    - inborn
    - immediate: "first line of defense"
    - neutrophil
    - does not change with prior exposure
    - less specific
  - adaptive immunity
    - acquired with exposure to foreign agent
    - delayed
    - highly specific to foreign agent
- adaptive immunity
  - humoral immunity (protein mediated)
    - proteins are called **antibodies (Ab)**
    - involves B cells
    - B cells make antibodies
    - B cells mature in the _bone marrow_
  - cell-mediated immunity
    - involves T cells
    - T cells mature in the _thymus_
  - both B and T cells have **antigen (Ag)** receptors
- B cell Ag receptors = Ab = Immunoglobulin (Ig)
  - forms
    - membrane bound
    - secreted
  - can recognize
    - small molecules
    - proteins
    - DNA
    - carbohydrates
    - lipids
- T cell receptor (TCR)
  - two chains: alpha and beta
  - forms
    - membrane bound only
  - can recognize
    - peptides presented by **MHC class 1 and 2**

## properties

### specificity
- $V\_H$. variable domain of heavy chain
- $V\_L$. variable domain of light chain 
- hypervariable regions = complementarity determining regions (CDRs)
  - 3 of them
  - encode the **loops** of the Ab
  - small diff in AA seq => large diff in affinity for Ag
- each B cell expresses 1 Ab => unique specificity for 1 Ag

### diversity
- Susumu Tonegawa => Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1987
- multiple gene segments -> shuffled to get diversity
  - Heavy chain
    - Variable (n = ~45)
    - Diversity (n = 23)
    - Joining (n = 6)
  - Light chain
    - Variable
    - Joining
  - 1 of each V, D, J need to be brought together to form functional Ab
  - mediated by intrachromasomal recombination at the heavy and light chain genes
    - called **VDJ recombination**, is lymphocyte specific
    - recombination mediated by Rag1 (Recombination activating genes) and Rag2
  - diversity
    - each V/D/J segment has a distinct amino acid sequence
    - **junctional imprecision**; recombination leads to insertion/deletion of nucleotides
    - **somatic hypermutation = affinity maturation** (T-cell mediated)
  - **allelic exclusion** in order for each B cell to only have one type of Ab (either maternal or paternal chromosome)

### memory
- memory B cells
- effector functions of antibodies
  - neutralization
  - induce phagocytosis
  - killing (NK cells)
